# PythonDash
Beginner Dash application that runs on top of Flask, React and Plotly. Used to display population data for US cities from a population dataset.
<br>
This application can be ran containerized with SSH enabled with the Dockerfile in this repo. Additionally, this has a azure-pipelines.yml within that can be used to configure CI/CD Docker Image deployment to Azure DevOps pipelines(replace the values with your own as needed).
